# Context Engineering Protocol

Chinese version: [CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_PROTOCOL.zh.md](./CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_PROTOCOL.zh.md)

This protocol distills portable workflow methods from memory-first and skill-driven agent systems into repo-owned Harness Engineering assets.

It is not a Claude-only or Codex-only feature guide. It defines how durable context should be stored, loaded, retrieved, redacted, and promoted inside the harness.

## 1. Goals

Use this protocol to:

- reduce repeated human restatement of the same project context
- keep high-value context durable across session resets and handoffs
- retrieve prior state in stages instead of front-loading full transcripts or logs
- prefer repo-owned memory surfaces over chat-only recall or tool-private memory
- keep sensitive or non-retainable context out of shared durable state unless explicitly required

## 2. Context Surfaces

Not all context belongs at the same layer.

Recommended precedence:

1. repo-owned contracts and entry files
2. current task packet, plan, and structural-scope notes
3. repo-owned memory surfaces such as wiki pages, hot caches, graph reports, and durable notes linked back to source tasks
4. evidence summaries, review summaries, and decision logs
5. raw evidence such as commands, logs, traces, and screenshots
6. local-only notes, personal preferences, or tool-managed auto-memory

Rules:

- Keep entry surfaces short and deep by link.
- Every durable memory page should cite the source task, evidence, review, or contract that justifies it.
- If two surfaces disagree, prefer repo-owned contracts and current task state over private or tool-managed memory.
- Do not treat tool-local memory as a source of truth when the repository already has explicit state.

## 3. Progressive Retrieval

Retrieve context in layers.

### Layer 1: Index

Use compact signals first:

- task IDs
- file paths
- short summaries
- graph or wiki index entries
- review finding titles
- decision labels

### Layer 2: Scoped Narrative

Then load only the bounded story that explains the current branch of work:

- relevant task packet sections
- scoped wiki pages, hot-cache notes, or graph reports that link back to source artifacts
- `summary.md`
- review findings
- timeline or decision summaries

### Layer 3: Raw Detail

Fetch raw artifacts only after the first two layers narrow the need:

- `commands.json`
- full logs or traces
- screenshots
- transcript fragments

Default retrieval order:

```text
entry guides -> task packet -> repo memory index -> summary/review -> raw evidence
```

Rules:

- Prefer the current file, task, or affected subgraph.
- If a graph or structured query surface exists, use it to constrain retrieval before opening raw files.
- Batch related raw retrieval instead of opening many small artifacts one-by-one.
- Avoid replaying the same transcript or log fragments into context after the summary already captures the point.

## 3.1 Promotion Rules

When the same project fact, boundary explanation, or debugging orientation gets re-explained across sessions, promote it into repo-owned memory.

Rules:

- Prefer plain Markdown, JSON, or HTML artifacts that the repository can version, diff, review, and link.
- Promote summaries, indexes, and citations, not full transcripts.
- Memory entries should stay scoped: one topic, one source chain, one owner or source of truth.
- Promotion targets can include a repo wiki, hot cache, guide update, decision log, or graph report.

## 4. Resume And Checkpoints

Long-running work must survive context reset through repo state, not through chat memory alone.

Use durable artifacts for resume:

- task packet
- evidence summary
- review artifact
- decision log
- explicit resume artifacts listed by the task packet

Use checkpoints or rewind features for reversible exploration when the runtime supports them, but keep these rules:

- checkpoints are for experimentation, not for auditable closure
- checkpoints are not a substitute for version control
- once an experiment wins, write the chosen path back into repo state

## 5. Sensitive Context

Shared durable state should not become a secret dump.

Rules:

- Store secrets in shared artifacts only when the repository explicitly requires it and the storage path is approved.
- Otherwise store redacted placeholders, stable aliases, or operator-only references.
- Tool adapters may offer private tags, local-only notes, or excluded memory scopes. The portable method requirement is simpler: non-retainable input must stay out of shared durable state.

## 6. Adapter Guidance

Tool adapters should help the protocol, not replace it.

### Skills And Guides

Use progressive disclosure:

```text
metadata -> focused instructions -> referenced resources/scripts
```

Do not front-load large manuals when a short entry guide plus linked depth is enough.

### Hooks And Context Injection

Hooks may preload, validate, or summarize context, but they should:

- inject only relevant and bounded material
- prefer summaries over raw transcripts
- deduplicate repeated history
- avoid blocking primary coding work because an auxiliary helper is temporarily unavailable

### Failure Semantics

Memory or context helper failures should usually degrade gracefully.

Block the workflow only when the failure means:

- a contract or safety rule cannot be enforced
- the retrieved context is known to be misleading
- a required audit trail would be lost

## 7. Task Packet Usage

For long-running, high-context, cross-session, or sensitive tasks, add a short `Context Strategy` section to the task packet:

```md
## Context Strategy

- Entry Sources: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, current task packet, latest review summary
- Retrieval Order: `entry -> summary -> raw`
- Retrieval Helpers: `none | codegraph | graph report | wiki hot cache`
- Promotion Target: `none | repo wiki | decision log | guide update`
- Sensitive Context: `none | redact tokens and keep secrets out of .harness artifacts`
```

This section does not replace linkage or evidence. It simply makes the loading order and privacy boundary explicit before work begins.
