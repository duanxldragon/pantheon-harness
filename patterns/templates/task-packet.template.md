## Contract Anchors

- `path/to/contract.md`

## Scope

### In

- explicit work

### Out

- explicit non-goals

## Assumptions and Open Questions

- Confirmed Facts: `none | facts already verified from code, contracts, logs, or user input`
- Working Assumptions: `none | current assumption that keeps work moving`
- Open Questions: `none | ambiguity that should stop execution or change the plan`

## Expected Files

### Create

- `path`

### Modify

- `path`

### Do Not Touch

- `path`

## Implementation Notes

- notes

## Minimum Viable Approach

- Selected Rung: `skip | reuse | stdlib | native platform | installed dependency | small local code | new dependency`
- Why This Is Enough: `<one sentence>`
- Upgrade Trigger: `none | condition that would justify the next rung`

## Success Criteria

- Behaviour Outcome: `<observable result>`
- Verification Signal: `<command, test, or evidence that proves the result>`
- Regression Watch: `<behavior that must remain unchanged>`
- Economics Watch: `none | token/cost/cache/retry/delegation signal that should stay within reason`

## Context Strategy

- Entry Sources: `AGENTS.md`, repo-local agent configuration file, current task packet, latest review summary | none
- Retrieval Order: `entry -> summary -> raw`
- Retrieval Helpers: `none | codegraph | graph report | wiki hot cache`
- Promotion Target: `none | repo wiki | decision log | guide update`
- Response Budget: `terse | standard | detailed`
- Sensitive Context: `none | redacted or local-only handling rule`

## Method Readiness

- Consumer-Specific Controls: repository contract | checker | smoke path | none
- Required Sensors: command | review | runtime evidence | none
- Required Evidence: command summary | screenshot | smoke result | runtime gap | review summary
- Ratchet Decision: no-repeat-observed | guide-updated | sensor-added | gate-updated | template-updated | adapter-updated | registry-only
- Deferred Code Issues: none | symptom plus recommended follow-up task

## Delivery Governance

- Design Gate: spec reference | short boundary note | none
- Development Gate: expected files declared | do-not-touch declared | none
- QA Acceptance Gate: command | browser | runtime | human review | none
- GitHub Governance Gate: method-gate | repo-quality-gate | runtime-evidence-gate | external-flaky | not-applicable

## Structural Scope

- Affected Subgraph: `<entry -> core path -> exit/side effect>` | `none`
- Boundary Crossings: `none | ui -> api | service -> datastore | package -> external-service | plugin -> host | downstream -> upstream`
- Risk Nodes: `none | auth handler | payment service | permission service | job scheduler | generator orchestrator | deployment workflow`
- Graph Focus: `none | cycle-check | hub-check | call-depth | sensitive-input-flow`

## Verification Plan

- `command`

## Linkage

- Task ID: <task-id>
- OpenSpec Change: openspec/changes/<name>/ | none
- Plan References: plan references, workflow references, or resumable execution artifacts | none
- Evidence Directory: .harness/evidence/<task-id>/
- Review File: .harness/evidence/<task-id>/review.md | none

## Evidence Required

- command result summary
- screenshots if UI changed
- smoke result if browser flow changed
- session economics snapshot or explicit gap if the task is long-running, delegated, or cost-sensitive
- review summary

## Human Gates

- none
