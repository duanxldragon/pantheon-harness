# Harness Engineering Contract

Chinese version: [HARNESS_ENGINEERING_CONTRACT.md](./HARNESS_ENGINEERING_CONTRACT.md)

Type: Contract
Layer: method
Status: Active

This document defines the tool-agnostic Harness Engineering protocol. It constrains how AI agents, automation tools, and human engineers receive tasks, read context, modify code, verify results, record evidence, and enter review.

## 1. Goal

Harness Engineering makes the repository itself the execution environment instead of locking process knowledge into a specific tool.

Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenHands, Aider, other agents, and human engineers may all participate in development, but they must follow the same repository protocol:

1. task boundaries are defined by contracts, design docs, and acceptance docs
2. tools are responsible for execution, verification, and evidence
3. critical decisions require a human gate or review gate
4. completion must be supported by tests, checks, runtime or browser evidence when relevant, and synchronized docs

## 2. Scope

This document applies to any repository that adopts the method, including but not limited to:

- web frontends, backend APIs, CLIs, batch jobs, data pipelines, mobile apps, infrastructure, libraries, and documentation repositories
- any task where an agent creates, modifies, or deletes code or docs
- any task that affects architecture boundaries, APIs, schema, permissions, security, runtime quality, or user experience
- multi-agent and human-agent collaboration where task boundaries, verification, evidence, review, and handoff must remain stable across tools

## 3. Non-Goals

This document does not define tool-specific shortcuts, private prompts, or plugin behavior. Tool-specific instructions belong in `.agents/adapters/` or the corresponding tool configuration.

This document does not replace:

- downstream repository entry files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or equivalent files
- downstream repository contracts under `docs/contracts/*`, `docs/designs/*`, or `docs/acceptances/*`
- project-specific overlays, scanners, CI gates, or business architecture rules

## 4. Core Principles

### 4.1 Repository Protocol Comes First

Critical rules must live in the repository, with the following priority:

1. direct user instructions in the current session
2. repository entry files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules`, or equivalent files
3. tool-agnostic protocol under `docs/harness/*`
4. `docs/contracts/*`, `docs/designs/*`, and `docs/acceptances/*`
5. tool adapters and private agent skills

If a tool adapter conflicts with a repository contract, the repository contract wins.

### 4.2 Tools Are Executors Only

Codex skills, Claude skills, Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, and similar tool features are adapters only. They may improve the workflow, but they must not become the only source of truth.

If a critical constraint exists only in a tool-specific configuration, migrate or summarize it into `docs/harness/*` or the relevant repository contract.

### 4.3 Humans Own Goals And Judgment

Humans are responsible for:

- defining goals and priorities
- deciding cross-layer boundaries and tradeoffs
- approving schema, permission, deletion, upstream contract, and high-impact operational changes
- reviewing evidence and residual risk

Agents are responsible for:

- reading context through the task packet
- implementing the change
- running verification
- saving evidence
- producing review-ready notes

### 4.4 Evidence First

It is not enough to say "done", "verified", or "should be fine". The executor must provide:

- commands that were run
- pass or fail results
- runtime, browser, screenshot, smoke, log, metric, or trace evidence when relevant
- known unverified items
- whether affected docs were synchronized

### 4.5 External Evaluator By Default

For `non-trivial` work, the harness should explicitly separate:

- implementer posture
- reviewer posture

The implementer may provide self-check notes, but "I checked it myself" is not the default completion decision.

The following work should default to an independent reviewer or explicit review gate:

- any task that crosses a Section 6 human gate
- security, permission, audit, schema, or trust-boundary work
- release, CI, secrets, deletion, or other high-impact operational changes

If only self-review is possible because of environment or task scale, the reason and residual risk must be stated explicitly.

### 4.6 Constraints Must Be Upgradeable And Retireable

Repeated failures should not only patch code. They should ratchet into guides, templates, sensors, or gates according to `FAILURE_RATCHET_POLICY.en.md`.

Old workarounds must not accumulate forever. After major model or tool upgrades, review which constraints can be downgraded, replaced, or removed according to `HARNESS_RETIREMENT_REVIEW.en.md`.

### 4.7 Default Execution Guardrails

Unless work is explicitly trivial, execution should apply `EXECUTION_GUARDRAILS.md` by default:

- think before coding: separate confirmed facts, working assumptions, and open questions
- simplicity first: walk `MINIMAL_COMPLEXITY_LADDER.md` and choose the smallest load-bearing approach
- surgical changes: declare `Do Not Touch` boundaries and only touch files and lines that carry the requested behavior
- goal-driven verification: define `Success Criteria` and the verification signal before declaring completion

## 5. Standard Workflow

All non-trivial tasks must follow this flow:

```text
Intake -> Context -> Plan -> Red -> Green -> Verify -> Evidence -> Review -> Handoff
```

### 5.1 Intake

Read the task packet or user request and declare:

- primary layer
- dependency layers
- touched contracts
- implementer posture
- reviewer posture
- expected verification
- human gates

### 5.2 Context

Read the necessary docs according to the repository reading order. Do not do unbounded full-repository reading.

Recommended reading order:

1. repository entry files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules`, or equivalent files
2. documentation map such as `docs/README.md`
3. contracts, designs, and acceptance docs matching the task layer
4. task packet, change record, issue, PR description, or implementation plan
5. project-specific overlay docs only when the task explicitly adopts that overlay

### 5.3 Plan

Non-trivial tasks must have a minimum plan. Cross-layer tasks, new features, refactors, drift governance, and sensitive configuration changes must use a task packet.

Classification between `trivial` and `non-trivial` follows `TRIVIALITY_CLASSIFICATION_POLICY.en.md`.

### 5.4 Red

When behavior can be pinned down with a test or check, write the failing test or failing check first.

Exceptions must be explained:

- documentation-only cleanup
- exploratory audit work
- external dependencies that cannot be run in the current environment

### 5.5 Green

Implementation must stay within the task packet scope. Do not opportunistically refactor unrelated code or "fix" issues that have not been attributed.

### 5.6 Verify

Choose the smallest verification set that matches the change surface:

- backend: relevant unit, integration, or service tests
- frontend: type-check, lint, build, smoke, and browser checks as relevant
- contracts: schema, API, permission, security, dependency boundary, configuration, and document-link checks defined by the repository
- runtime/UI: smoke, screenshots, console errors, logs, metrics, traces, performance signals, or an explicit runtime gap
- visual quality: follow `VISUAL_QUALITY_PROTOCOL.en.md` for UI-affecting work

### 5.7 Evidence

Save or summarize verification results according to `VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE_SPEC.en.md`.

### 5.8 Review

Follow `REVIEW_LOOP_SPEC.en.md` and any repository-owned code review standard for findings-first review.

Except for trivial work or clearly documented low-risk exceptions, review should exist as a post-implementation external evaluation stage rather than as a synonym for author self-check.

### 5.9 Handoff

The handoff note must include:

- changed files
- commands run
- pass/fail result
- evidence path
- review mode
- known gaps
- required human decisions

### 5.10 Default Adoption For Ordinary Work

Unless a task is explicitly trivial under Section 8, any code, contract, design, acceptance, UI, route, permission, i18n, schema, or workflow change must ship with:

- a task packet or explicit link to an approved parent task packet
- verification evidence in the repository-defined structure
- a review mode, or a documented reason why only self-review was used
- known gaps recorded instead of omitted

This rule applies equally to ordinary feature delivery, bugfixes, behavior-changing refactors, UI polish, and cross-layer remediation work.

## 6. Human Gates

The following operations require explicit human confirmation first, or must enter a PR review gate explicitly:

- deleting large numbers of files or directories
- changing database schema, migrations, or seed semantics
- changing permission models, menu models, audit models, or i18n key rules
- changing repository core contracts, architecture boundaries, public APIs, or shared data models
- overriding upstream-defined shared behavior in a downstream repository, plugin, or extension
- introducing a new runtime dependency, external service, or security boundary
- changing CI gates, release flow, or secret-handling behavior

When a task crosses a human gate, it should also default to an independent reviewer posture instead of implementer self-check only.

## 7. Definition Of Done

A task may be marked complete only when all of the following are true:

1. ownership layer and cross-layer boundaries have been declared
2. the corresponding contracts, design docs, and acceptance docs have been read
3. implementer posture and reviewer posture have been declared, or the reason for self-review-only mode has been documented
4. the task packet or minimum plan has been executed
5. verification commands matching the change surface have been run
6. verification evidence has been saved or summarized
7. docs have been synchronized when contracts, interfaces, menus, permissions, i18n, database, or acceptance semantics changed
8. UI-affecting work has visual evidence, browser evidence, or a recorded reason for not running the visual gate
9. unverified items and residual risk have been listed
10. the review gate has no unresolved P0/P1 findings
11. document governance checks pass when the repository enables them

## 8. Trivial Task Exceptions

The following tasks may skip task-packet creation, but must still obey relevant contracts:

- single-word typo fixes
- small clarifications to comments or README files
- read-only queries, log inspection, or status reporting
- formatting-only changes that do not affect behavior and are covered by an existing formatter command

Even exception tasks may not bypass human gates for sensitive operations.

If trivial classification is disputed, use `TRIVIALITY_CLASSIFICATION_POLICY.en.md` and fall back to `non-trivial` by default.

## 9. Adoption Path

Harness maturity progresses in three stages:

1. protocol layer: establish `docs/harness/*` and `.agents/*` so the workflow is tool-agnostic
2. evidence layer: establish task packet, evidence schema, and evidence directory conventions
3. gate layer: push repository-specific boundaries, quality checks, runtime evidence, and document governance into scripts and CI
