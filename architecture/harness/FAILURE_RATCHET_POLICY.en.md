# Failure Ratchet Policy

Chinese version: [FAILURE_RATCHET_POLICY.md](./FAILURE_RATCHET_POLICY.md)

Type: Policy
Layer: platform
Status: Active

This policy defines how a repeated failure should move from a one-off problem into a repository-owned method asset.

## 1. Goal

The harness should not merely record that a problem happened. It should define where the control surface must move when the same failure pattern happens again.

The ratchet loop exists to:

- keep repeated failures out of chat-only memory
- promote experience from manual reminder into reusable rules
- eventually let deterministic sensors or gates catch high-frequency failures

## 2. What Counts As A Repeated Failure

Treat the following as repeated failures by default:

1. the same root cause or control gap appears again across different tasks, PRs, or sessions
2. review repeatedly reports the same issue class, but the repository still lacks a guide, template, checker, or smoke path for it
3. the same gap recurs in an upstream template, shared library, overlay, or multiple downstream repositories
4. the same class of issue reappears after handoff because context was lost

Do not force the label for:

- one-off typos
- clearly isolated business exceptions with no reusable value
- checker false positives that are not real failure patterns

## 3. Ratchet Levels

### 3.1 Level 0: Single Failure

On the first occurrence, record the failure pattern in at least one of:

- the closeout note
- a review finding
- `knownGaps` in verification evidence

The goal is traceability, not punishment.

### 3.2 Level 1: Second Occurrence

On the second occurrence, promote the issue into at least one feedforward control:

- `AGENTS.md`
- a task-packet template
- an acceptance checklist
- a contract, design, or review guide
- a repo-local how-to or playbook

If nothing is promoted, the ratchet did not happen.

### 3.3 Level 2: Third Occurrence Or Cross-Repo Recurrence

On the third occurrence, or when the issue already recurs across repositories or modules, prefer promoting it into a feedback control:

- test
- static check
- harness checker
- smoke case
- browser or runtime evidence gate
- failure-registry entry

The `failure registry` is one default landing file, but not the only one. If the problem can be automated directly, prefer landing it as a sensor.

### 3.4 Level 3: Severe Or Persistent Failure

Any of the following may skip levels:

- security, permission, audit, schema, or data-damage risk
- high-impact work that already crosses a human gate
- issues already affecting release quality or inheritance stability

These may be promoted directly into a blocking gate, required landing file, or required release-review item.

## 4. Recording Requirements

Each ratchet promotion should record at least:

- what the failure pattern is
- which artifact or sensor it was promoted into
- why that control level was chosen
- what the next verification window is

Recommended recording locations:

- `docs/harness/failure-registry.md`
- `HARNESS_OPEN_TASKS.md`
- release notes
- the relevant task packet, review, or evidence

## 5. Relation To The Failure Registry

The `failure registry` records which issues are important enough to remain durable failure patterns.

It does not replace:

- guide updates
- template updates
- automated closure through checkers or smoke

Use this rule of thumb:

- do not add one-off explanations to the registry
- if repeated human reminder is needed but automation is not ready, prefer the registry
- if automation already exists, keep only a short registry summary and source linkage

## 6. Rollback And Exceptions

If a promotion later turns out to be based on a false positive, bad attribution, or a temporary tool defect, it may be downgraded.

Any downgrade must also record:

- why the original judgment no longer holds
- which artifact was downgraded or removed
- when the next review should happen
